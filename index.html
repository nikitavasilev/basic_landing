    <h1>Best Things To Do in New York City</h1>
    <p>
      Even if you're not mesmerized by the city's soaring skyscrapers and monuments,
      you'll be blown away by its flourishing arts, food, fashion and nightlife scenes.
      You can spend your morning browsing Fifth Avenue's designer racks and your afternoon
      catching stunning city views from the Top of the Rock Observation Deck.
      Or, if you're an art lover, you can admire the striking works on display
      at the Met and the Guggenheim before feasting on ethnic fare in Chinatown or Little Italy.
      If you still have some energy (and cash) left over,
      don't miss the chance to snag tickets to an award-winning Broadway show or hop over to one of the low-key
      rooftop bars and jazz clubs illuminating the Meatpacking District after dark. How we rank Things to Do.

      <h3>Brooklyn Bridge</h3>
      <p>
        Some visitors decide to skip the bridge in favor of other attractions,
        but if you're short on money, this truly is one of the best ways to experience
        the city and to get a unique view of either borough. You can take the A or C train
        to the High Street stop in Brooklyn and stroll along the bridge back to Manhattan.
        It takes about 30 minutes to walk from one side to the other, and it's free to visit.

        <h4>Brooklyn Bridge</h4>
        <p>
          One of many signature landmarks of New York City,<br>
          the Brooklyn Bridge is also one of the oldest suspension bridges in the country.<br>
          Its six-lanes (and one pedestrian and bicycle walkway) span the East River,<br>
          connecting Manhattan to Brooklyn. Walking across the bridge remains a tourist pastime.

      <h3>Central Park</h3>
      <p>
        This part-park, part-museum, part-concert hall swallows central Manhattan,
        and many of the city's most notable attractions are situated next to it
        or within its limits (the Guggenheim, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and
        the American Museum of Natural History, to name a few).
        But travelers insist that you shouldn't just pass through Central Park
        on your way to another place. This 843-acre green space is a favorite of
        New Yorkers and tourists; you can come here to exercise, dine, go to the zoo and more.</p>

        <p> 
          â€œCentral Park is fantastic year-round,and is a must-see for anyone<br>
          coming to New York," says Josephine Danielson,head concierge at the<br>
          Four Seasons Hotel New York. "People may not realize Central Park<br>
          has several hidden treasures. If youâ€™re looking for something<br>
          different, I tell guests to visit the Conservatory Garden."

      <h3>Empire State Building</h3>
      <p>
        New York City Tourist 101 dictates that you must swing by this landmark structure in
        midtown Manhattan. And despite the hefty admission fees, the crowds and the long lines,
        recent visitors insist that you won't be sorry. In fact, taking a trip to the top of
        the Empire State Building is either the perfect way to begin or end your Big Apple
        excursion â€“ on a clear day you'll be able to the see the city's major highlights some
        1,050 feet beneath you. Pick up the multimedia tour, available in eight languages,
        which guides visitors through the icon's exhibits and views with additional background
        on the building's history. The tour is included in the admission price and
        given to guests to enhance their visit.

        <h4>Empire State Building</h4>
        <p>
          Looking up at the art deco skyscraper from the ground is also pretty spectacular,<br>
          especially in the evenings when there's a little mood lighting. The Empire State<br>
          Building's tower lights have maintained a tradition of changing color to recognize<br>
          various occasions and organizations throughout the year since 1976. In 2012, its<br>
          iconic tower lighting system was modernized by replacing its flood lights with a<br>
          dynamic lighting system unique to the Empire State Building, with more than 16<br>
          million colors in limitless combinations and effects. The Empire State Building<br>
          stages dazzling light shows celebrating holidays and events, often synchronized<br>
          to music broadcast simultaneously on iHeartMedia's radio stations.
